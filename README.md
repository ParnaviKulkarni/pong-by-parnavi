A basic Python game built using turtle module.
I have made this game by following a tutorial by Christian Thomson on freeCodeCamp.org youtube channel.
The main purpose behind creating this mini project was to learn new things. I learnt about Python's turtle module and how to use it. 
Also got to learn about animation basics like allignment of objects, speed of animation etc. 
Thus I have also included comments in my code for anyone who is also a beginner and would like to get the gist of these concepts.
