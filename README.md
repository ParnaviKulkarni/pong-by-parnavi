A basic Python game built using turtle module.
I have made this game by following a tutorial by Christian Thomson on freeCodeCamp.org youtube channel.
The main purpose behind creating this mini project was to learn new things. I learnt about Python's turtle module and how to use it. 
Also got to learn about animation basics like allignment of objects, speed of animation etc. 
Thus I have also included comments in my code for anyone who is also a beginner and would like to get the gist of these concepts.

I've also attached .exe file so the end product of this mini-project is accessible to those who do not have python installed in their systems. So those with a windows system can enjoy this little game without having to go through tedious process of installing python and its libraries.

***Instructions to play the game***
-This is a two player game.
-There are two paddles which can be controlled each by one player.
-Player A can press: W:Up and S:Down
-Player B can press: UP(arrow key):Up & DOWN(arroy key):Down.
-Each player has to dodge the ball using their paddle. If the player misses, another player gets 1 point.
-Player with maximum points wins.
